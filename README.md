This page has the source code for the Androids mod for Starmaker Story.
You can find the releases here do not have BepInEx included, and you'll have to download and install it manually before this mod.
Download file **BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip** from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3 and paste all of the zip file's contents inside your game's folder. 
Then you can do the same for the mod's release.
